### Areas
Think of areas as micro applications that can have thier own set of controllers and middleware that support the custom decorators... Main itself is an area that simply loads all other areas. An area is a way to further seperate concerns for an example see the sample project.

When creating areas it is usually best to follow this structure. 
  - Area Generator is coming soon 
  - Controller Generator should list available Areas
